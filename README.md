## How it works

1. **Hover** over any item in your inventory, auction house, chat link, etc.
2. **Press `Ctrl+C`** (default keybinding).
3. A popup appears with the Item ID pre-selected.
4. **Press `Ctrl+C` again** to copy the ID to your clipboard.

## Installation

### From CurseForge

1. Install the [CurseForge App](https://www.curseforge.com/download/app).
2. Search for **Copy Item Id** in the WoW addons section.
3. Click **Install**.

### Manual installation

1. Download the latest release ZIP.
2. Extract the `CopyItemId` folder into your `World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns\` directory.
